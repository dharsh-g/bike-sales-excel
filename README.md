# Bike Sales Dashboard - Excel

## Introduction
In this project, I have analysed a bike company's data to understand different factors that are considered by the customers before making a purchase decision. The final output of this project is a dashboard which provides a comprehensive overview of bike sales data, allowing stakeholders to analyse trends, identify patterns, and make informed decisions.

## Data Cleaning
<li>Removing duplicates, unwanted cells and irrelevant columns.</li>
<li>Replacing values with more meaningful entries using FIND and REPLACE functions. eg: M with Married in the "MaritalStatus" column, F with Female in the "Gender" column etc</li>
<li>Changing the data type of "Income" column to currency.</li>
<li>Creating a conditional column based on the "Age" column to make out 3 different age brackets.using NESTED IF function.</li>

## Insights
<li>Both Male and female with higher average income in their respective category were more likely to purchase bike.</li>
<li>The majority of bike purchasers were in the 31-54 year age bracket i.e the Middle Age group.</li>
<li>People with a 0-1 MILE COMUTE WERE MOST LIKELY TO PURCHASE a bike FOLOWED BY 2-5 mile.</li>
<li>People with a 5+ mile commute were more likely not to purchase a bike.</li>

## Conclusion
<li>Middle Age Group (31-54) shows the highest number of purchases. The management should ensure that it should target this segmen of population.</li>
<li>An inverse linear relationship indicates that as the commuters' distance increases, they prefer other means of transportation other than bike riding so the company should focus on short distance commuters.</li>
